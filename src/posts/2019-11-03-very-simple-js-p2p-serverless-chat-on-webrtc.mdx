I recently wanted to check if it's possible to create a simple js chat with no servers in-between, so that you can directly talk with someone else via secure channel.

I found that some browsers support **WebRTC**. It wasn't clear for me at the beginning how to deal with it but eventually I was able to establish p2p connection with my friends in different networks. There is still a need for STUN/TURN servers to establish connection but as far as I know it's secure.

Currently demo chat works in **Firefox**. I had some issues with STUN servers in Chrome. I will gradually work on improving that thing. I encourage you to try out your own builds on WebRTC :)

The idea is that HOST get a connection code. HOST send to SLAVE his code somehow (through some other chat for example). Once the HOST paste code from SLAVE, p2p connection starts and they can talk, wow :D
